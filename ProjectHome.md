A powerful JavaScript written just to generate Karaoke in After-Effects using .ass timings.

## Help ##
I had this idea...  I need someone to create ScriptUI Panel for creating XML configurations and using KRK quite easily...  That's for those who don't script.  If you know about Adobe's Bridge Framework which is the framework for the UI in Adobe apps, please email me at pichus1@gmail.com . thanks.

## SVN Repo for Up-to-date Codes ##
http://code.google.com/p/aftereffectskrk/source/browse/trunk/krk/krk.jsx

Since the script is always under development, please use the SVN to fetch the up-to-date features and bug-fixes.

I won't be using the downloads, since it takes too much effort to submit codes to the downloads section.

## Downloads ##
For older codes.
